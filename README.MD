## How to Contribute to the Project

This project is constructed with `Writerside`, built with `GitHub Actions` and deployed on `GitHub Page`.

To make any update to this document project, please follow this guidance:

### JetBrains IDE & WriterSide

Writerside is currently a plugin of JetBrains IDEs. To use Writerside, install any JetBrains IDE first.

Since `ERA-Engine` is using `C#` and `GD Script`, we recommend using `JetBrains Rider`. It has community version which is free to use:

- [Install JetBrians Toolbox to Manage All Your JetBrains Products](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
- [Directly Download From Official Website](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

After installation, install `Writerside` plugin from JetBrains Plugin Marketplace.

1. Find the gear button, which means the settings button on the top right corner of the IDE.
2. Click on `Plugins` to go to Plugin page of settings.
3. Search `Writerside` in Marketplace and install it.
4. There might be a restart required.

### Editing

1. Open the repository in Rider.
2. On the left side, you will see a `Writerside` button. Click on it.
3. You will find a document instance called `ERA-Engine Documents`, which is the project we are working on.

Simply, you can use `Markdown` to construct your page. But Writerside also provides some customise features using `XML`, read [here](https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/en-us/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html) for official instructions.

### Commit & Build

Any comment and update will automatically call `GitHub Actions` to build the project and deploy it to `GitHub Page`, so don't worry about the build process.

If you only changes content in Writerside project, there should not be any errors in updating our document file.
